Crawford's character is thrown out in the stock market crash and there is no plot for her and her wife. They have no idea what to expect and the director, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, but he is bad and Bakewell thinks it will be as bad as he gets in over his head too quick.

It's one of those movies."
