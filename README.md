## How to Use

To customize TextRankerJS for your specific use case, follow these steps:

1. Add your examples to the `js/examples.js` file. The examples should be in the following format:

```javascript
const examples = [
    {
        "methodA": "Text generated by method A...",
        "methodB": "Text generated by method B...",
        "methodC": "Text generated by method C..."
    },
    ...
];
```

2. Adjust the pageSize variable in the js/main.js file to set the number of triplets displayed per page:

```javascript
const pageSize = 10; // Change this value to your desired number of triplets per page
```

By modifying these settings, you can easily adapt TextRankerJS to work with your own examples and preferred page size.
